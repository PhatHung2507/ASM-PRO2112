user.tieusukimcuong = Diamond is one of the two most known precious allotropes of carbon (the other form is graphite), with very high hardness and excellent refractive properties, giving it many industrial applications. and specialized in jewelry. Diamond is said to be a mineral with perfect physical properties. They are good materials for creating ground surfaces and only other diamonds, caged carbon crystals or ADNRs, can cut diamonds. That means we can keep the polished face very long and very well. 150 million carats (30,000 kg) of diamonds are mined each year with a total value of US$10 billion. In addition, about 100,000 kg of diamonds are prepared artificially every year.
user.tieusukimcuong1 = A diamond is evaluated according to a 4C quality system: "carat" (mass), "clarity" (transparency), "color" (color) and "cut" (cut) and today Sometimes people even evaluate according to 6C standards, adding "cost" (price) and certification (certificate, inspection). Only about 20% of the world's diamond production is used in jewelry, with 80% of lower quality diamonds used in industrial and research applications.[3] Although synthetic diamonds are produced in nearly four times the volume of natural diamonds, the majority of them are used for industrial purposes because most of them are small and imperfect diamonds, although they are currently This has improved markedly with new artificial diamond making technologies.About 49% of diamonds are mined in Central Africa and South Africa, although large numbers of diamonds are also found in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, Australia. Most of them are mined in extinct volcanoes deep inside the Earth, where high pressure and temperature change the structure of the crystals. Diamond mining is also the subject of disputes. There is also some controversy that the De Beers group has taken advantage of its monopoly in the diamond supply industry to control market prices, even though the company's market share has fallen to 50% in recent years.
